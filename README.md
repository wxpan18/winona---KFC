**Stopped here for a quick burger instead of heading to Rochester on a snowy night; place was packed with snowmobilers but we still got great service and my burger was awesome. It's not fancy by any means, but it's clean and the staff is always top notch and friendly - another reason to love the small town, out of the way bars.**

**What's Good?**
